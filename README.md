#  Vehicle Detection (Car Counter)

This repository contains a **vehicle detection machine learning project** that identifies and counts the number of cars in an image. Given an input image, the model detects all cars and returns the total count.

This project demonstrates computer vision techniques, object detection model training, and how to integrate the model into an application pipeline.

##  Project Overview

The Vehicle Detection project trains an object detection model to recognize cars in images. The model outputs bounding boxes and counts how many cars were detected.

The workflow includes:

✔ Data preprocessing and annotation  
✔ Training a computer vision model  
✔ Evaluating the model on test images  
✔ Deploying the model to infer and count vehicles from new images

##  Built With

✔ Python  
✔ Machine Learning / Deep Learning framework (such as TensorFlow / PyTorch)  
✔ Object Detection libraries or pretrained models (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN)  
✔ OpenCV or PIL for image processing  
✔ Jupyter / Colab notebook to train and test
